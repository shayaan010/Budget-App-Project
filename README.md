# Budget-App-Project
I created a budget app for students using Flutter, compatible with both iOS and Android. The app allows users to set a monthly budget, allocate spending for categories like groceries and food, and track actual expenses. It visually compares budgeted vs. spent amounts using a graph, helping students manage their finances effectively.
